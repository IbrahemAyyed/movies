- This is a simple movie library.
- We used Git, NodeJS, Angular6 and Firebase to compile it.
- To run it we have to download Git, NodeJS and Angular.
- I imported bootstrap in index.html and used the theme lumen supported by bootswatch.com.
- For building it I used most of the functions in services and the others I generated them in their module, then I called them in their corresponding positions. 
- For navbar I used app-routing, then I called it in app.component.html so that it's displayed in all the pages.
- For homepage I put some html content in homepage.html and styled it.
- For movies list I used the form search, form to add, update and delete the data. I listed the data as a table too.
- For authors I used two functions. The first function is listing which is getMovies and updateMovie to update the movies.
